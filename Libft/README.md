## Description

Libft is a robust and reliable library written in C, designed to provide functions similar to those in the standard C library. The library is particularly useful for students and those new to programming in C, offering a safe and well-coded set of functions that handle common tasks.

One of the main features of Libft is its focus on robustness and error handling. All functions are designed to handle edge cases, such as failed memory allocation or null pointers, preventing segmentation faults and making your code more stable and reliable.

This library is part of a larger project and serves as a cornerstone for most of my work. By using Libft, you're not just using a set of functions, but a tool that has been refined and proven in numerous projects.

## Installation Instructions##

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. **Download the library**: You can clone the library from GitHub using the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vpekdas/Libft.git
```

2. **Install a C compiler**: If you don't already have a C compiler installed, you will need one to build and use this library. You can install the [Clang compiler](https://clang.llvm.org).
   
- On a Mac, you should already have Clang installed as part of Xcode Command Line Tools. You can confirm this by running clang --version in your terminal. If it's not installed, you'll be prompted to install it.

- On a Linux machine, use the package manager for your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install clang
  ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Include the library in your project**: Add the following line at the top of your source code files:
```c
#include "../includes/libft.h"
```

2. **Compile your project**: When compiling your project, you need to tell the compiler where to find libft.a and to link against it. Here's an example:
```bash
clang your_program.c -LLibft -lft -o your_project_name
```

## Key Functions
Here are some of the key functions provided by this library:

- `ft_atoi(const char *str)`: Converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by `str` to `int` representation.
```c
char *str = "123";
int num = ft_atoi(str);
printf("%d\n", num);  // Outputs: 123
```

- `ft_calloc(size_t count, size_t size)`: Allocates memory for an array of count elements, each of them size bytes long, and initializes all its bits to zero.
```c
int *arr = ft_calloc(5, sizeof(int));  // Allocates memory for an array of 5 integers
```

- `ft_itoa(int n)`: Converts the integer n to a string.
```c
int num = 123;
char *str = ft_itoa(num);
printf("%s\n", str);  // Outputs: "123"
```

- `ft_putstr_fd(char *s, int fd)`: Outputs the string s to the given file descriptor fd.
```c
ft_putstr_fd("Hello, world!\n", 1);  // Outputs: "Hello, world!"
```

- `ft_split(char const *s, char c)`: Splits the string s into an array of strings according to the delimiter character c.
```c
char **words = ft_split("Hello, world!", ' ');
// words[0] is "Hello,", words[1] is "world!"
```

- `ft_strlen(const char *s)`: Returns the length of the string s.
```c
size_t len = ft_strlen("Hello, world!");
printf("%zu\n", len);  // Outputs: 13
```

- `ft_lstadd_back(t_list **lst, t_list *new)`: Adds the element new at the end of the list lst.
```c
t_list *list = ft_lstnew("Hello");
ft_lstadd_back(&list, ft_lstnew("world!"));
// list now contains two elements: "Hello" and "world!"
```

- `ft_lstnew(void *content)`: Creates a new list element with content.
```c
t_list *list = ft_lstnew("Hello");
// list now contains one element: "Hello"
```

- `ft_lstsize(t_list *lst)`: Returns the number of elements in the list lst.
```c
t_list *list = ft_lstnew("Hello");
ft_lstadd_back(&list, ft_lstnew("world!"));
int size = ft_lstsize(list);
printf("%d\n", size);  // Outputs: 2
```

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all those who provided the possibility to complete this project. A special gratitude I give to the contributors of the following tester programs:

* [libftTester by Tripouille](https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester)
* [libft-unit-test by alelievr](https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test)
* [libft-war-machine by 0x050f](https://github.com/0x050f/libft-war-machine)

These tester programs were instrumental in the development process. They not only helped me identify and correct errors quickly, but also introduced me to new testing methodologies and considerations I hadn't previously encountered. Their insights and expertise contributed significantly to the completion of this project.
